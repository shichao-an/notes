## Chapter 5. Standard I/O Library

The standard I/O library handles such details as buffer allocation and performing I/O in optimal-sized chunks.

### Streams and `FILE` Objects

Standard I/O file streams can be used with both **single-byte** and **multibyte** ("wide") character sets. A stream’s orientation determines whether the characters that are read and written are single byte or multibyte. 

* This book deals only with byte-oriented (single byte) streams.
* This book refers to a pointer to a `FILE` object, the type `FILE *`, as a *file pointer*.
