### **Chapter 2. Program Structure**

This chapter provides details about the basic structural elements of a Go program.

### Names

In Go, the names of functions, variables, constants, types, statement labels, and packages follow a simple rule: a name begins with a letter (anything that Unicode deems a letter) or an underscore and may have any number of additional letters, digits, and underscores. The names are case-sensitive: `heapSort` and `Heapsort` are different names.

Go has 25 keywords like `if` and `switch` that may be used only where the syntax permits; they can’t be used as names.

 | | |
-|-|-|-
`break`|`default`|`func`|`interface`|`select`
`case`|`defer`|`go`|`map`|`struct`
`chan`|`else`|`goto`|`package`|`switch`
`const`|`fallthrough`|`if`|`range`|`type`
`continue`|`for`|`import`|`return`|`var`

In addition, there are about three dozen *predeclared* names like `int` and `true` for built-in constants, types, and functions:

 |
-|-
Constants: | `true` `false` `iota` `nil`
Types: | `int` `int8` `int16` `int32` `int64` `uint` `uint8` `uint16` `uint32` `uint64` `uintptr` `float32` `float64` `complex128` `complex64` `bool` `byte` `rune` `string` `error`
Functions: | `make` `len` `cap` `new` `append` `copy` `close` `delete` `complex` `real` `imag` `panic` `recover`

These names are not reserved, so you may use them in declarations. Beware of the potential for confusion.

If an entity is:

* Declared within a function: it is local to that function.
* Declared outside of a function: it is visible in all files of the package to which it belongs.

The case of the first letter of a name determines its visibility across package boundaries:

* If the name begins with an upper-case letter, it is *exported* (visible and accessible outside of its own package and may be referred to by other parts of the program), as with `Printf` in the `fmt` package.
* Package names themselves are always in lower case.
